    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Crispy baked wings</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If you plan ahead, lay the wings on a rack on a rimmed baking tray and let them dry uncovered in the fridge overnight. Alternatively, pat them dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 250°F/120°C (all oven types). Put one oven shelf in the lower quarter of the oven and one in the top quarter.</li>
        <li>Line the tray with foil. Spray the rack on the baking tray with oil.</li>
        <li>Place the wings in a large bowl. Sprinkle over baking powder and salt. Use hands to toss well (or shake in ziplock bag) to coat wings evenly.
        </li>
        <li>Place the wings skin side up on the rack (ok if snug, they shrink). Bake on the lower shelf in the oven for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Then move the tray up to the higher shelf and turn the oven up to 425°F / 220°C. Bake for a further 40 to 50 minutes, rotating the tray halfway through. The wings do not need to be turned over.
        </li>
        <li>The wings are ready when they are dark golden brown and the skin is very crispy.
        </li>
        <li>Toss with Hot Sauce and serve immediately with Blue Cheese Dip and celery sticks. They can be served plain, with a dipping sauce or tossed in sauce. Wings also reheat crispy!
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together the Sauce ingredients. Keep warm or reheat just prior to using.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Blue cheese dip</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mash the blue cheese with sour cream until smooth (or to your taste).
        </li>
        <li>Add remaining ingredients and mix well until combined, using milk to get it to the consistency you want.
        </li>
        <li>Store in the fridge until required. Remove from the fridge 15 minutes before serving.
        </li>
    </ul>
